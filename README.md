# COVID-19 Campus Recovery Analytics
A repository for tools and applications meant to inform safe return to campus decisions for colleges and universities amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 


## Campus Recovery Tools and Insights

### Open-Source Tools -- See repository
Here are some tools we are developing to help campus planners:

* <span style="color:red"> [Coming Soon!] </span> Classroom layout designer -- helping campus planners estimate capacities of classrooms and assign seats to allow for social distancing
* <span style="color:red"> [Coming Soon!] </span> Room assignment optimization models   -- We are developing tools to help campus planners identify which classes should be assigned to which rooms in a way that accounts for reduced room capacities and alternative modes of course delivery (e.g., hybrid models where some classes are delivered online)

### Other insights
We will be posting our findings to our website

* Analysis of students’ academic and extracurricular network
* Surveys on student preferences and behavior
* Campus Disease Spread Simulator
